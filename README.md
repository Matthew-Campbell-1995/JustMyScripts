# JustMyScripts_mkII
All of these scripts were written in c# (in Microsoft Visual Studio) for the Unity environment for game development. 
In the Unity environment, everything is a GameObject or component thereof, and the engine automatically handles basic things like time passing, rendering, and collision detection.
GameObjects share a cooridate grid.
Unity requires scripts to extend Monobehavior, and calls certain funtions automatically, like start when the object is created, and update every frame.
