# JustMyScripts_mkII
All of these scripts were written in C# (in Microsoft Visual Studio) for the Unity environment for game development. 
In the Unity environment, everything is a GameObject or component thereof, and the engine automatically handles basic things like time passing, rendering, and collision detection.
GameObjects share a coordinate grid.
Unity requires scripts to extend Monobehavior, and calls certain functions automatically, such as start when the object is created, and update every frame.
Many of my variables are temporarily public, so they can be easily accessed via the Unity editor.
